# Frequency Analysis of Words

The script performes word frequency analysis and prints `top` most common words in the text.

# Usage

Either import `get_most_frequent_words` in your module or run the script passing it path to the text file to analyze:
```
$ python3 lang_frequency.py example_input.txt
фыв qwe wqe asd zxc правда qwewq kd koko lо
```

By default, the script outputs ten most common words. This can be changed:
```
$ python3 lang_frequency.py example_input.txt --top 3
фыв qwe wqe 
```
